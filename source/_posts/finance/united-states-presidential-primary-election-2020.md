美股其实是需要去管理时间窗口的，尤其是在大选年，所以了解美国候选人的动向和时间节点还是比较重要的，所以不如慢慢随着选举的展开学习一下美国的选择制度，侧重点在于流程上和候选人政策理念对市场的影响上




## United States Presidential Primary Election

> **美国总统初选**是指在[美国总统选举](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美国总统选举)的候选人提名过程中，各州及领地举办的一系列[初选](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/初選)（primary election）与[党团会议](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/党团会议)（caucus）。
>
> [美国宪法](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美国宪法)对此并没有任何规定，这是各政党自己逐渐发展出来的一套流程。有些州只举办初选，也有些州只举办党团会议，还有些州两者皆有。每个大选年，各州的初选与党团会议并非同时举行，而是会持续数月，通常于一月下旬或二月上旬开始，于六月中旬结束。各州与当地政府会举行初选，而党团会议则是由各政党自己举行的内部会议。一州的初选或党团会议通常为[间接选举](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/间接选举)，选民并非直接决定总统候选人，而是选出代表参加各党[提名大会](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/美国总统提名大会)。这些代表则会在大会上选出各党总统候选人。

## Caucus

Caucus : 党团会议，“某个政党的地方成员举行会议，推举党内参加代表大会的成员或者指定竞选公职的候选人”。

现在美国有以下的州在总统大选中采用党团会议（Caucus）形式：

* 科罗拉多(Colorado)

* 夏威夷(Hawaii)

* 明尼苏达(Minnesota)

* 北达科他(North Dakota)

* 爱奥华(Iowa)

* 内华达(Nevada)

* 缅因(Maine)

**2020 美国初选 爱奥华州为例**

党团会议和我们一般理解的投票选举不一样，参加的人必须聚集在某个地点。任何人都可以站起来发言支持某位候选人。所以竞选活动是党团会议的一个重要部分，所以在党团会议期间，候选人应该尽量派遣大量人员到各个党团会议地点进行游说。

任何登记为政党成员的选民都可以参加党团会议。比如在第一个举行党团会议的爱奥华州99个县共有1774个党团会议集会地点。这些集会地点可以是教会、学校、社区中心等等。

选举结果如无意外一般一两天就会出来，作为今后的选举风向标，可以提前布局相关的板块，比如医药板块
