## Schedule 13D

* Any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) must report that acquisition on a Schedule 13D within 10 calendar days of crossing the 5% threshold (Rule 13d-1(a)). The exceptions to this rule (i.e., persons who can file a short-form Schedule 13G instead of a Schedule 13D) are described below. 

* The Schedule 13D must be amended “promptly” to report any material change in the information provided, including any acquisition or disposition of 1% or more of the class. Rule 13d-2(a)

The determination of what constitutes “promptly” is based upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the materiality of the change in information triggering the filling obligation and the filing person’s previous disclosures. Any delay beyond the date the filing can reasonably be made may not be considered prompt.



## Schedule 13G

* If an investor falls into one of the three categories discussed below, the investor should file a Schedule 13G, which is a shorter disclosure form, instead of a Schedule 13D.

* Schedule 13G can be filed by three classes of investors - Exempt Investors (Rule 13d1(d)), Qualified Institutional Investors (Rule 13d-1(b)), and Passive Investors (Rule 13d1(c)). 

> - Rule 13d-1(b) - [Institutional Investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investors) that acquire securities in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent nor with the effect of influencing control of the issuer.
>
> - Rule 13d-1(c) - Passive Investors that have not acquired the security with the intent nor effect of influencing control over the issuer, are not an "institutional investor," and are not directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the security.
>
> - Rule 13d-1(d) - Exempt Investors under Section 13(d)(6)(A) or (B) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_Exchange_Act_of_1934), or because the beneficial ownership was acquired before December 22, 1970, or because the person is otherwise not required to file a statement on Schedule 13D.
