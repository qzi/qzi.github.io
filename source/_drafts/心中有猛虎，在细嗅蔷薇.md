Siegfried Sassoon (1886 - 1967 / Kent / England)

**In me, past, present, future meet**

To hold long chiding conference.  
My lusts usurp the present tense  
And strangle Reason in his seat.  
My loves leap through the future’s fence  
To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.  

In me the cave-man clasps the seer,  
And garlanded Apollo goes  
Chanting to Abraham’s deaf ear.  
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.  
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,  
Since there your elements assemble.
